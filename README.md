<!-- ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY -->
## About This Repository

I wanted to create a few repositories to showcase the assignments I worked on throughout my education. This repository will host my Visual Basic assignments. I will admit I am uploading these projects way after I have already finished the course, so I will do my best to explain what the purpose of each assignment was. Please do not use or copy my code if you are taking the VB class at OCCC.
